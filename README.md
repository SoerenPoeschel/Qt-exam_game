# Qt-exam_game
This is the examination project for a module in my studies: http://hki.uni-koeln.de/c-semesterarbeit-sose-2018/
The directory mostly includes the first of four possible steps.
In the main directory you may find my final program's files, of which you'll find uncommented QT project versions in Teilaufgabe1.
objekte_und_avatar is heading to the second step, not yet including the save function and other requirements.
In the other directories you may find solutions for parts of the project.
